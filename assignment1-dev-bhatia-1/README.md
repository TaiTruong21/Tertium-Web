# Product Website 
#### Individual Assignment - Due Tuesday, April 14 at 11:59pm.

In this assignment, we will build upon our web development chops by making our very first landing page!

The main emphasis of this assignment is to create a few HTML pages that offer:

1. A clear **Key Value Proposition**
2. A simple **call-to-action**
3. An "about us" section that details your team, and your vision statement

The call-to-action is a prompt to get your customer to take a step. In this case, you're trying to get them to sign up for your newsletter to get more information. Build this as a separate page that includes a form, which collects their first name, last name, and email address and stores it in a MySQL database. Make this experience pleasant and clear!


On the backend, you should have a Docker container setup running a webserver and a MySQL server.

If you need refreshing on this, look back on the ECE 140A lecture on Database Integration.

## Implementation Requirements 

### Your solution must include the following page (types):

1. A home/landing page that clearly identifies your product, and describes the key value proposition 
2. A "call-to-action" (registration) page -- to get customers to sign up for your (non-existent) newsletter
3. An 'about us' type page, that describes your team, your members, and your vision 

### Coding requirements 

1. You're free to use any server language, but we suggest you stick with Python
2. You may NOT use a CSS framework (like Bootstrap). You must write your own CSS code. However, you can "borrow ideas" for CSS elements from Codepen (hint hint)
3. Your site must be responsive. It must be usable on desktop and tablet sized computers. It's also recommended you try to make it work on mobile (we'll talk about "mobile first design" in this week's lecture).
4. Your HTML, CSS, and Javascript (if any) must be valid. We're going to check!

You are NOT required to implement any features using Javascript, but you're free to do so. However, you may not use any pre-written Javascript libraries. You must develop any code you want to use by yourself. 


## Submission

Please commit all of your code and submit to this repository. Do NOT include the persistent MySQL database, so make sure that you add an entry for that into your gitignore file.

This assignment will be due on **Tuesday, April 14 at 11:59pm**.
